# operationEncyclopedia
Scour the ancient wikis to attain as much historically accurate Everquest information as possible for 2001/2002 era.

The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must attain!

The goal of this project is to build a web skimmer for old alakhazam and eqtraders corner to gain accurate information for future
classic everquest eqemu servers. The first thing that will be looked at is quest accuracy in all possible areas, ie. accurate drop rates, 
xp rates, factions, turn ins, and of course rewards.

There will be 2 sets of quests when this is completed. The first is without multiple turnin feature, the second is with multiple turnins.

How can you help?

 - More sources would go a very long way.
   - Do you know of any old wikis?

 - What should the next step of operationEncyclopedia be?
   - I suspect that our current eqemu xp formulas are incorrect. I have no proof that is not purely anacdotal. The numbers given by classic posts do not line up with ours cleanly, but they do scale logically.
   - Should all drops be investigated if possible?
   - Other ideas welcome (:
